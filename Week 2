Module 2: TRANSISTORS / LOGIC GATES / COMBINATIONAL LOGIC


Hardware: 

How to store a bit on device. 
Classic CPU. Billions transistors integrated.
Silicon: 

Transistor: What is it?  WhY IS it made of silicon.

4004 = 2300 transistor in the same are as the chip on hand. In 70's 

Decrease the size of transistors. 

Mores of Law doesn't go with chip

4.5 Billion by Intel on : Intel 15 Core Xeon Ivy Bridge .

We if go down to the size of transistor that boders to the size of an atom than it might not be possible to reduce the size more than that. 


One Transistor: How it is made?

It is a electrical switch made from silicon.

Transitor composted of 3 component. Gate, Drain and Source. GDS

It acts like a electrical switch. What switch does? Connects two terminal togather to complete the cycle so the current can flow. 

But in transistor there is no moving part. It actually turns on electronically. Here the G has the ability to turn the Drain and Source so that the current can flow through them 


How is transistor made?

Any copper in a wire is composed of a lattice of atoms bonded together via their electrons. Not all electrons need to participate to bond. So those which are not participating in bonding are 
called free electrons.
