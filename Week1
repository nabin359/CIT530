How is Semiconductors are made? How transistor actually look like?



Converting Decimal Integer to Binary Integer 

100:

First Position = 10^2 =1*100 
Second Position = 10^1 = 0*10
Third Position = 10^0 = 0 * 1

Now sum it up First Position , Second and third makes it 100

Binary to Decimal:
111

First 2^2 + Second 2^1 + Third 2^0
1 * 4 + 1 * 2 + 1 * 1
= 7

So the decimal of 111 is 7
