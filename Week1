How is Semiconductors are made? How transistor actually look like?

Converting Decimal Integer to Binary Integer 

100:

First Position = 10^2 =1*100 
Second Position = 10^1 = 0*10
Third Position = 10^0 = 0 * 1

Now sum it up First Position , Second and third makes it 100

Binary to Decimal:
111

First 2^2 + Second 2^1 + Third 2^0
1 * 4 + 1 * 2 + 1 * 1
= 7

So the decimal of 111 is 7 

Decimal to Binary

Now 7

Divide 7 by 2 until answer is zero (Record Reminders)
7/2 = 3 Rem = 1
3/2 = 1 Rem = 1
1/2 = 0 Rem = 1

Likewise, the binary of decimal 7 is 111.

The Basic Model of a Computer

The MACHINE (Over Worked clerk, our cpu and his two desk drawers.

4 basic Parts
  Memory for Data
  Arithemetic Logic Unit (ALU)
  Memory for Instruction:
  Programme Counter (PC) Now serving Sign! What door should you open next? Open door number 2!


Big Question?

How preciesly is the information strored?
What is the format?
How do we design the circut?
How does the clerk actually perform those calculation?
How do we put together to answer the question?

Introduction to Computer System

Computer is a binary digital system.

What does binary mean? What does digital mean?

What is a bit? It is a basic unit of info in a computer.

BIt is a contraction of two words.
BIT = Binary Digit


n bit to represent 2^n possible things.

Why use a binary system?

Either on or off. or voltage present or voltage absent.

==============================


Weighted Positional Representation


REpresentation of Integer in Binary

Arthemetic with Binary Numbers

Addition, Substraction, multiplication, Division


Finite Width AND overflow with non negative numbers 

Carry out is also called overflow

==========================================
Representation of negative integer in Binary (2C)

How to represent negative in computer. It is just zero and one.
Sign-magitude.

For example 
0001 is a positive 1
but
1001 is negative 1. The leading # indicates the sign of the number.

1 complement. (1C)
Simply flip each digit to represent negative.

2's Complement (2C)

for example the decimal 5 is 0101

To make it negative just flip the binary i.e 1010 (like in 1C)
But as per 2c just add 1 to the least significant number in binary. i.e 1011

Also remember to throw away the carry out . Meaning overflow is going to get a new defination. 

=================================
Arithmetic in 2C:


Sign Extension: When we need to add number with different lengths. Unsigned numbers is easy just padd is but signed means number with negative. 

positive just add zeros padd it with
it negative padd it with 1 ok.

This is how the sign extension works. 

==========================


The art of encoding- Mapping the Physical world into our Binary world. 

How about the non numeric data. Like colors.

 Bits will do it to encode the letter from a to z. 

ASCII 
 2^7 = 128 combinations

UniCODE 2^32


Representing Numbers in Hexadecimal


Binary is base 2
Decimal is base 10 and Hexadecimal is base 16


Remember 0,1,10,11, 100,101, 110,111
