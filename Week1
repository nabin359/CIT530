How is Semiconductors are made? How transistor actually look like?

====================================================================================

Converting Decimal Integer to Binary Integer 

100:

First Position = 10^2 =1*100 
Second Position = 10^1 = 0*10
Third Position = 10^0 = 0 * 1

Now sum it up First Position , Second and third makes it 100

Binary to Decimal:
111

First 2^2 + Second 2^1 + Third 2^0
1 * 4 + 1 * 2 + 1 * 1
= 7

So the decimal of 111 is 7 

Decimal to Binary

Now 7

Divide 7 by 2 until answer is zero (Record Reminders)
7/2 = 3 Rem = 1
3/2 = 1 Rem = 1
1/2 = 0 Rem = 1

Likewise, the binary of decimal 7 is 111.
